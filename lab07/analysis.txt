NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: The worst case time complexity happens when BFS searches through all cells in the maze.

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: The worst case time complexity happens when DFS explores every cell in the maze once.
