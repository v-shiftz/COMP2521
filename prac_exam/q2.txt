Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.

The compilation error occurred because the program tries to access the
graph struct, which is not accessible because the graph is an ADT. The
program can be fixed by using the function in the Graph.h interface
that inserts an edge.
