Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.

B. According to the pre order traversal, the tree contains the node:
        7
       / \
      2   8
    this in post order traversal will be 2, 8, 7. Hence the option B is the only choice.

(b)

Value in the root node: 
36
Value in the left child (of the root): 
32
Value in the right child (of the root): 
39
(c) Give the rotations that are performed (if any) as a result of
    inserting each value.

After inserting in 25, 22 rotated to the left

After inserting in 8, 13 rotated to the right followed by 5 rotated to the left
