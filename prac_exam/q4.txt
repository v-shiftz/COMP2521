Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

Only Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm can be used for constructing the mininum spanning trees.
But based on the way the edges are added, we can see that this should be the Kruskal's algorithm as
it seems to be adding the edges based on the minimum weight, which is differet from the way Prim's algorithm
works as it adds all the edges first.
