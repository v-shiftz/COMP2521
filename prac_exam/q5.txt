Question 5

(a) Describe and justify the steps you would take to determine which
    sorting algorithm the program uses.

To determine the sorting algorithm, I can give it a special list of (alphabet, number) and use the 2 algorithms to sort this
special list. For example:
(A, 2)
(B, 1)
(A, 4)
(C, 2)
(A, 3)
For selection sort (stable sorting algorithm), it will return:
(A, 2)
(A, 4)
(A, 3)
(B, 1)
(C, 2)
While for median-of-three quicksort (unstable sorting algorithm), it may return:
(A, 2)
(A, 3)
(A, 4)
(B, 1)
(C, 2)


(b) Is the sorting algorithm that the program uses stable? How confident
    are you in your conclusion? Explain your answer.

The output of the program looks stable. However, it may not be 100% stable as the example is too small
and we would require a bigger sample size to differentiate between stable and unstable.
